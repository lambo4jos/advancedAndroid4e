ATTENTION:
========

At the time of writing, these code samples were written for the Eclipse ADT Bundle (Android IDE) because Android Studio was not the official IDE yet.  I have included additional code samples to work with Android Studio, so you will find both Android Eclipse code samples and Android Studio code samples.  Support for the Android Studio code samples will be extremely limited due to these code samples not being covered in the content of Fourth Edition book.  However, I wanted to provide these as a reference so that readers would be able to see how these same exact code samples work in Android Studio.

Welcome
========

Welcome to the code samples that accompany the Addison Wesley Professional book titled "Advanced Android Application Development, Fourth Edition", written by Joseph Annuzzi, Jr., Lauren Darcey, and Shane Conder.

These code samples will help you understand the contents of the book by allowing you to interact with application projects that implement many of the Android SDK features discussed throughout.

You can download the files as a ZIP package using the Download ZIP button seen towards the right of this page.

You could download all the files as a ZIP: https://github.com/lambo4jos/advancedAndroid4e/archive/master.zip

Or you could issue the following command from a command line to get the code.

`git clone https://github.com/lambo4jos/advancedAndroid4e.git`


FOR ECLIPSE ADT BUNDLE (Android IDE) ONLY
========

For the `Chapter 17 - Location and Maps` project `SimpleLocation` and for the `Chapter 20 - Analytics` project `SimpleStats`, make sure to configure the `google-play-services_lib` project as a library project. The library can be found within the directory `../<path_to_sdk>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/`

For the `Chapter 07 - Advanced UI` project `SimpleActionBars`, make sure to configure the `android-support-v7-appcompat` project as a library project. The library can be found within the directory `../<path_to_sdk>/extras/android/support/v7/`



Happy learning!
